          <h2>Motherhood</h2>
     
          <p>First things first; I am PROUD to have been a teenage mother. From 1995 to 2000, I was focused and building my family. There were NO mistakes involved when it comes to the creation of my children. Each one of them were born from unconditional love through conditional actions. My firstborn son arrived Fall 1995, on the last day of the semester for Thanksgiving break. Fueled by my determination to start my family, I had pushed hard to complete high school, graduating at 16 years old pregnant, 2 whole years earlier than scheduled. I had been promoted from 10th grade to graduating high school in 9 months while earning a 4 year scholarship to help pay for college. All for him.</p>
            
          <p>In Summer 1997, I received my 1st apartment. It was a 2 bedroom 2 story apartment in the Sheppard Square Housing Development which was a city housing project that went by my income. I wanted to have some security for us, so I began savings accounts in the preparation of emergencies and/or school. My second son arrived in Spring 1998, during my 2nd year at JCC studying Human Services (social work) and working for the Housing Authority of Louisville (HAL) Special Programs: Starpoints Nuturing Parenting Program. I was 18 years old. My job consisted of having my children with me at work while learning how to take care of them so it was the absolute perfect position.</p>

         <p>While working for HAL, I created the proposal for a childcare center inside the city's Clarksdale Housing Project; Clarksdale Childcare Development Center for the neighborhood residents. I also assisted in the proposal development for the Mabel Wiggins Family Investment Center,1999. I truly enjoyed every moment working for them. It was also in Fall 1999 that I found out I was pregnant for the 3rd time. I was still attending college fulltime and working 12 hour days so I was damn near due by the time I noticed. It was a very busy time! My last born son arrived in Summer 2000, just 4 days ahead of my 21st birthday. BOOM.</p>
            
         <p>There has been no greater achievement in my life than the 3 times I was blessed to give birth. Being their mother is and will always be the best part of my life's existence! And there's nobody but their daddy that I would have wanted to have them with.I really wanted to get married... eventually, but I realized after 3 children and <i>multiple</i> indiscretions/ infractions by their daddy, that it wouldn't be a good idea or outcome. We came to understand that the only thing we did right TOGETHER is creating and raising our boys. He is the greatest dad but was a horrible boyfriend.</p>
