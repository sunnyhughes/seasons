      <h2>Growing up with them</h2>
    
          <p>Oh my my my, the plans I had for us! Being that I was a child who had children, the boundaries of what can/can't be done were skewed. I was learning through trial & error every day. Basic essentials were understood: bottle, diaper, sleep, fragile body & head but things of choice: what to play, how to do something, was a toss up. We ate breakfast for dinner and dinner for breakfast. I knew why you don't give a bunch of sugar to a kid however I didn't know why little kids couldn't have spicy foods so I let them have it...only to have to deal with the messy aftermath. We learned how to be a family regardless of outside influences through gaining extended family members who would prove to be a lifelong connections. I was and <b>am</b> a firm believer in it takes a VILLAGE to raise a child.</p> 
            
         <p>As I said before, we REALLY grew up together. Having to get up early in the mornings, I quickly learned the importance of the bedtime ritual. Knocking all 3 of them down for the night was no easy task! I had to wear them out before they wore ME out! We would do all types of things like have indoor stair luges with pillow armor or playing blackout hide-n-seek in a pitch dark house. I taught them how baby powder will make a spark in the dark. (Here's a hint--It involves hand-to-face action) And as they got older, it got weirder. They had rats, birds, fish, and cats as pets. They paper mache the whole back of the lower level of my house. We dissected an albino frog on the sidewalk. We had Co2 BB gun wars which HURT but was fun when we ambushed others. There was not so gross stuff too like they learned how to build bikes from parts and work on their own cars.</p> 

        <p>The events of our family times were trips to museums, zoos, playgrounds, historical sites, and different states. The boys even went to Florida without me! I've still not seen the ocean...and dont care to. They had a chance to attended every school activity/event that they desired: band, chess, performing arts, football, basketball, track, proms, dances, out-of-towners, over-nighters, and pep rallys. My middle son was blessed to participate in a trip to meet the 1st African American President of the United States, Barack O'Bama!</p>
          
          
        <p>Anything that they wanted to do, I made sure they got to experience it even when it meant me working 2 jobs without something for them to have everything. I should say WE made sure it happened for them because their dad and paternal family were involved with them from the very beginning.</p>
