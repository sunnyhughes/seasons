              <h2>Higher Education</h2>
                
                <p>From graduating high school at 16 years old to being accepted into college at 17, I knew that education would be key to my family succeeding. A well-educated mind can rule the world. I planned my majors around something that would benefit my children even before I finished college: Early Childhood Education and Human Services (Social work).</p> 
                
                <p>I always felt like my life had been centered around helping others, help themselves even as a child. And I got the perfect opportunity to help others at age 16 while with the LMHA - Special Programs. The StarPoints Nurturing Program allowed me to engage and assist other teenage parents and single parents involved in the court system learn how to be good or better parents. There, under the supervision of one of the best women I've ever had the pleasure to meet in life, Johnella P. Wimberly, I was introduced to a world of caring and sharing, growing and learning, that I had never known. And she truly changed my life for the better. I loved her. I love her. I miss her. R.I.P.</p>
                

          <h2>Working for Them</h2>
           
            <p>After my 4 years with StarPoints Program (LMHA), I went to work for JCPS as a substitute early childhood teacher. Being that it was a temporary position, I wasn't guaranteed hours so I also went to work at Toys-R-Us. Boom!! Another blessing comes our way. My position(s) at TRU allowed me to care for my children better than I'd ever imagined. I received benefits from the start with advancements possible at every level including major discounts on everything in the store. I went from being a cashier to apparel supervisor, to apparel manager to early morning shift manager, all within 3 years. My 7 years with Toys R Us gave me access to opportunities and deals that let me be extra generous with my children. It was totally the perfect job for a young mother being that I got a chance to still be childish all while being an adult. Loved it!</p>
